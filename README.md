# Wallpaper Collection 

A Universal Remote Source for wallpapers

## Where Did I Get These?

Thanks to Distro tube  for collecting a large number of wallpapers [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) 
His gitlab repo gave me a great starting point for this repository, I do have a collection o my own I can add later on. 
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

## Style of Wallpapers

The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos.  There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
